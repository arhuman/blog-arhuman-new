# What is the average salary for Perl programmers in 2020?

If I have no definitive answer on this, the [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/the-top-coding-languages-with-the-highest-salary-2020-4)
has some insights:

HackerRank polled 116000 developers about their salaries and got interesting results:

* Perl is associated with an average global salary of $84,025.50
    (54.2% higher than the global average salary)
* Scala is associated with an average global salary of $77,159.60
* Go is associated with an average global salary of $72,691.30
* Python is associated with an average global salary of $56,670.90
* JavaScript is associated with an average global salary of $55,690

Without more information about the polled panel it's hard to state this results as "Truth" but they seems to confirm
personal beliefs:

* The salary is more linked to the scarsity of resources than to the trendyness of the associated technology.
* Perl resources are less and less available.

You know what ? It's good to be a Perl programmer :-)
